# eliteyachts

Hi and welcome to this awesome and complete web page project that I developed a while back. This website is called eliteyachts, and it's simply a webpage that allows the user to interact with other users, a user can register, login, logout, create a profile with a personal profile picture, check out yachts submitted for sale by other users, post a yacht to the page specifing it's price, name and description and so on. A user can also comment on other users' yacht posts, and also like a posted yacht to save it to their profile. Moreover, a user can use the google maps on the home page of the website, as well as the search for a specific city to get weather forecast results. It is quite dynamic and responive and I used a variety of tools and techniques, from MongoDB, to NodeJS, Vanilla CSS, REST APIs, google maps API, authentication and association, and lots and lots of backend and frontend work.


This is one of my projects that I take pride in and I am also planning on enhancing it and add more functionality as soon as I can.
